### Unocovering biomarkers of psychosis

<p>Psychotic disorders are debilitating and affect roughly 3% of the US population.	According to recent estimates, the economic burden in the US of schizophrenia was 343.2 billion USD. Early identification of these disorders can have dramatic affects on future outcomes which will have direct reliefs on future costs. As the age of onset of these disorders occurs relatively late in life, it is crucial to identify markers of disease onset as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Eyetracking during visual tasks is one method of differentiating individuals with psychosis from healthy controls. Individuals with psychosis show greater irregularities in both amount of eye movements and blinks and can be reliably predicted based on these numbers. Another predictor of psychosis is pupil dilation which is often attributed to attentional capture which is known to be reduced in psychosis. In this project I used an inverse correlation analysis to directly examine probabilities of increased pupil dilation in response to reported changes in perception and attentional capture in people with psychosis and healthy controls.</p>
