### Unocovering biomarkers of psychosis

<p>Psychotic disorders are debilitating and affect roughly 3% of the US population. According to recent estimates, the economic burden in the US of schizophrenia was 343.2 billion USD. Early identification of these disorders can have dramatic affects on future outcomes which will have direct reliefs on future costs. As the age of onset of these disorders occurs relatively late in life, it is crucial to identify markers of disease onset as soon as possible. One way to identify useful biomarkers is through the careful study of visual dysfunction in these populations. Using visual perception, we may be able to identify tests that better differentiate patients with psychosis from those without. A particularly fruitful avenue of visual dysfunction that can be used to test psychosis is bi-stable perception. These are stimuli that, despite having one non-changing physical stimulus, can perceptually appear one of two ways. It has been shown that people with psychosis alternate between these two percepts at rates different to those of healthy controls. Using these stimuli I attempt to identify factors that affect and cause psychotic symptoms.</p>

[Eye-Tracking In People With Psychosis](https://github.com/kkillebrew/SFM/tree/main/EyeTracking)

<p>Eyetracking during visual tasks is one method of differentiating individuals with psychosis from healthy controls. Individuals with psychosis show greater irregularities in both amount of eye movements and blinks and can be reliably predicted based on these numbers. Another predictor of psychosis is pupil dilation which is often attributed to attentional capture which is known to be reduced in psychosis. In this project I used an inverse correlation analysis to directly examine probabilities of increased pupil dilation in response to reported changes in perception and attentional capture in people with psychosis and healthy controls.</p>

[Modeling Neural Data To Predict Viewing Conditions](https://github.com/kkillebrew/SFM/tree/main/modeling)

<p>Psychotic individuals show a variety of visual abnormalities and processing deficits which are, in part, responsible for positive psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations. These can occur through a wide variety of neural abnormalities, such as impaired attentional allocation or and overall impairment of suppressive mechanisms. In this project, in order to test how impairments in a wide variety of possible neural functions may affect visual processing I modeled the neural processes involved in bi-stable perception using a divisive normalization model. This model utilizes two layers, in which nodes at each layer normalize activity of each other by the average activity within that layer. This allows for the use and manipulation of neural factors, such as attention or normalization, to be tested on the overall outcome on perception. I found that of the factors tested, attention seems to play the largest role in predicting similar perceptual outcomes to that of psychotic individuals.</p>

### Understanding visual biases when viewing data

<p>Understanding how people perceive and understand visualized data (aka graphs and plots) is key to creating easily understandable and interpretable data visualizations. A commonly overlooked aspect of perception that highly affects data visualization is ensemble encoding, the process by which people quickly and efficiently extract high level summary information from perceptual input. For example, when presented with an image of a group of people viewers are able almost immediately extract high level group information, such as average viewing direction, heading direction, expression (happy vs sad), location within the image, size, and skin tone (color) at a much more accurate rate than if they were to try to extract information from a single person. This phenomenon also affects viewing data visualizations. For example, in a scatter plot perception of the position of individual data points can be affected by the perception of the average location of all the data points. Thus skewing the perceived location of the data points towards the average location. Therefor, understanding how these biases affect perception is crucial to understanding how to better create effect data visualizations. Image recreated from Whitney & Leib, 2018.</p>

[Perception Of Group Characteristics Affects Perception Of Individual Items](https://github.com/kkillebrew/EnsembleEncoding)

<p>When objects are presented together as part of a group, people extract summary perceptual information from the group, such as the average location, size, or orientation. In this project I examined how adding visual uncertainty (e.g. noise) might affect their ability to gather visual information about individual objects in the group. I showed that given decreased information for an individual object will lead to an increase in people’s reliance on the average. In other words, people will more overtly utilize average information when deciding individual information in the presence of heavy visual noise. This has large implications on how to more efficiently present cluttered data visualizations, such as scatter plots or bar charts.</p>
